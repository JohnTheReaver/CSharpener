# CSharpener
A gcc compiler in discord. Just simply drag and drop your .c script with a dm containing !compile and a compiled executable will be send back.
The bot runs on linux. So if your on windows the executable will most likely not work. So if you're on windows you might need to change the code to let it run on windows.

## To run:
1) `git clone https://github.com/JohnTheReaver/CSharpener`
2) `cd CSharpener`
3) `pip install discord subprocess`
4) `python3 main.py`
